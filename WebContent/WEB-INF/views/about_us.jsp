	<h2><br><u>About us</u></h2>
	<p> <br>This project has been developed as a student
		project from ECE Paris. The goal was to develop an application to help
		coworkers to create documents together with videoconferencing. It's
		accessible from a browser and doesn't need any downloader
		registration. It's free, open-source and uses the WebRTC technology.<br><br>
